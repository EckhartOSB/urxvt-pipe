DESCRIPTION

Perl extension for rxvt-unicode (aka urxvt) to enable the user to pipe
the terminal window's display to some other program.  You can pipe the
selected text, the text of the visible window, or all text (including
scrollback).

INSTALLATION

See the man page for urxvtperl(3) for a full discussion of Perl
extensions.  Enable this extension using one of the methods documented
there.  For example, you could place the script urxvt-pipe in
/usr/local/lib/urxvt/perl, then add the following to .Xdefaults:

URxvt.perl-ext: default,urxvt-pipe
URxvt.keysym.C-0x005c:    perl:urxvt-pipe sa|farg 'urxvt -e vim %s'
URxvt.keysym.A-0x005c:    perl:urxvt-pipe sv|farg 'urxvt -e vim %s'

This creates two ways to pipe the terminal window display to vim in another
terminal window:  Ctrl+\ will send any selected text, or all text if none is
selected.  Alt+\ will send either the selected text, or only the visible text
if none is selected.  The former is useful for capturing a lot of text that
has scrolled by, while the latter is useful for capturing sessions from an
ncurses application.  Of course, you aren't limited to using vim.


SYNTAX

As you can see, the user command requires special arguments to indicate
what text should be piped to whom.  The general form is:

urxvt-pipe source | destination

where

source		is a combination of any of the three following letters:

		a = all text in the window, including scrollback
		s = selected text
		v = all visible text in the window

destination	is a command to which the text will be piped.


OPERATION

The letters in source are used left-to-right until one of them produces some
text.  Thus, "sa" will attempt to find selected text first, and if none is
selected it will use all text instead.  If no text is found in any of the
sources specified, then nothing happens.

The destination is opened via a pipe from Perl, so if the program so named
requires a terminal window or a shell, then you must provide for that in the
command.  Because text will be piped to the stdin of the command, you may
need to use the provided shell script farg to copy piped text to a file that
is then passed as an argument.  Both of these techniques are shown in the
vim example above.
